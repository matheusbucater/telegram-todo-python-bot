# telegram-todo-python-bot
This is a telegram bot that I made with python and mongodb hosting on heroku that works like a to-do app.  
You can ask the bot to a add a task, complete a task, uncomplete a task, delete a task and show all your tasks.  
If you want to talk to my bot, just type @todo_telegram_bot in your telegram searchbar.
